# How to create a Controller

Usage

```bash
php antonella make:controller <name>
```

For creating a Controller we will use this command from the terminal

`php antonella make:controller MyController`

Out: src/Controllers/MyController.php

This command is going to create the Controller inside the folder src/Controllers/MyController.php, you don't need
to provide the .php to the Controller

## Example

`php antonella make:controller Admin\DashboardController`

Out: src/Controllers/Admin/DashboardController.php
